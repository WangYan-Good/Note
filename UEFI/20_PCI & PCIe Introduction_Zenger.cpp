  PCI Introduction - What's PCI BUS ?
  The PCI Local Bus is a high performance 32-bit or 64-bit with multiplexed address and data lines.The bus is intended for use as an interconnect mechanism between highly integrated peripheral controller components, peripheral add-in cards, and processor / memory systems.
